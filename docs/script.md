PalWallet is an AI-powered crypto agent that seamlessly combines intelligent automation with direct user control, making both simple and complex blockchain operations more efficient.

Demonstration
Let's begin the demonstration.

With PalWallet, users can interact via chat to perform simple operations, such as checking their wallet address and executing basic transactions.

On the backend, it integrates with Coinbase AgentKit and ChatGPT to process these operations efficiently.

While this chat-based approach is convenient, more complex and strategic tasks often require additional tools beyond simple chat interactions. This is where dApps Fusion comes in.

Introducing dApps Fusion
PalWallet includes dApps Fusion, enabling users to connect directly with decentralized applications (dApps) via WalletConnect. This AI-powered crypto agent serves as a co-pilot, adding valuable external services such as security checks for safer transactions.

Let's connect to a sample dApp.

For instance, when performing a bridge transaction, PalWallet can simulate the transaction and provide an AI-driven analysis. (At this stage, the AI analysis is a mock implementation.) Users can review the simulation results via chat before proceeding with the transaction.

Once confirmed, we can check the transaction details in an explorer.

Flexible Interaction with PalWallet
With PalWallet, users can choose between:

Chat-based commands for quick and simple operations.
dApps interaction via WalletConnect for advanced functionalities.
Architecture Overview
PalWallet is built on a robust architecture, leveraging:

- Coinbase AgentKit
- Autonome
- Base Network

By combining these technologies, PalWallet successfully bridges the gap between user needs and the capabilities of an AI-powered crypto agent.

Thank you so much, this is all about PalWallet.
